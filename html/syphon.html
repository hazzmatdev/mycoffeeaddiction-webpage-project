                            The most fun brewer in my collection! It will never not be satisfying watching this thing do its magic.
                            This brewer, interchangeably called a syphon or vacuum brewer, is a form of infusion brewer, like a french press,
                            as opposed to brewing via percolation, as a drip coffee maker, pour-over, or even an espresso maker. As such this
                            brewer makes very highly extracted, strong coffee.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Compared to a french press, this brewer makes completely ground free coffee! I enjoy it much more than a french press
                            due to that. On top of that who doesn't enjoy intentional open flames!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the water boils in the bottom flask the pressure inside increases, driving the water to the top flask. After you pull
                            away the heat source, the steam pressurizing the bottom flask condenses, creating a vacuum that sucks the liquid from the top
                            back down, leaving the grounds behind on the other side of the filter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This brewer requires a little bit of setup and takes a little more effort to clean. The coffee you use should be a 
                            little coarser than pour-over so as to not clog the filter, but not as coarse as a french press.
                        </p>

                                    First, when this happens, stop brewing immediately. Don't attempt to heat the coffee back
                                    up to boiling as that will create bitter burned coffee which is far worse than underextracted
                                    coffee. It will also create hard to remove burned coffee-stains on the bottom of your glassware.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This may happen to you for two reasons. Firstly, the seal between the top and bottom flask was
                                    broken. If this happens, insert the top flask more firmly next time. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Secondly, the flame may have been disturbed too much while boiling, leading to a loss of pressure. If this 
                                    happens, make sure any fans can't disturb the flame and you aren't moving quickly around it to avoid blowing it
                                    around. You may need to raise the height of the flame next time. In addition, you can help prevent this
                                    by ensuring that your water is vigorously boiling before making the seal between the top and bottom flask.
                                    Don't worry, it gets much cooler when its in the top flask.

                                </p>

                            <td>
                                A little bubbling in the top flask is normal as steam escapes from the bottom flask. If there is an excessive
                                amount of bubbling then the brewing coffee could be boiling. In that case lower the flame if you can.

                                    Your flame might need to be raised, but theres only so much you can do. This is why you boil the water via a 
                                    more effecient method first.
