                                While your machine is heating up, measure out and grind your coffee finely. The instructions for
                                your machine, or portafilter, should have the amount necessary in grams. Usually between 12-18 for a

                                shot glass under the portafilter's spouts and pull a blank shot. Pour out the
                                hot water, then repeat, this time leaving the hot water in the shot glass (to keep
                                it warm)

                                To slowly heat up the machine, leave it heating for around 15 minutes (depending on machine).
                                Afterwards pull a blank shot into a shot glass and set aside (to keep it warm)

                                After you have heated up your espresso machine, pull out the portafilter and dump whatever water
                                is still hanging out in it.

                                Carefully dump your finely ground coffee into the portafilter, use a scoop if you need to. Softly tap
                                the sides of the portafilter to even out the grounds

                                Use your tamper to firmly press down on the coffee in the portafilter, then twist it while applying
                                pressure. Brush away any loose grounds. If you have a deep basket, you may need to tamp twice, once when 
                                half the grounds are placed in the basket and once after all are in the basket

                                Begin pulling a shot of espresso, if you are dialing in your settings, take note of how long this takes. For a
                                double shot, this should take around 30 seconds, lighter roasts tend to take a little more and darker a little less.

                                is popular now (like stumptown hairbender). Otherwise, your coffee
                                may be underextracted. Make sure you are evenly and firmly tamping the grounds.
                                If that doesn't help, grind finer (its okay if the shot takes too long, your goal is
                                good tasting coffee, not an arbitrary shot time)

                                Your coffee is overextracted, grind a little coarser. If that causes your coffee to be
                                underextracted, then instead tamp down less firmly. Failing that, you can use less coffee.
